# Simple PHP OOP CRUD Application with Form Validation
This is a basic PHP application that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by creating a registration form with input validation. The application uses Bootstrap for styling.

# Features
User registration form with Name, Email, Password, and Password Confirmation fields.
Input validation for required fields, minimum and maximum character lengths, valid email format, and password confirmation.
OOP design with separate classes for input handling and validation.

# How to Use
1- Download the project files to your local server or hosting environment.
2- Make sure your web server is set up to serve the files.
3- Open the index.php file in a web browser.
4- Fill out the registration form:
  1- Enter a Name (at least 2 characters, max 50 characters).
  2- Enter a valid Email.
  3- Enter a Password (at least 8 characters, max 15 characters).
  4- Repeat the Password in the "Password Again" field.
  
5- Click the "Submit" button.
6- If there are any validation errors, they will be displayed below the form fields.

# Project Structure
index.php: Main registration form page with input handling and validation logic.
classes/inputClasses.php: Contains the Input class for handling input data from POST and GET requests.
classes/validateClasses.php: Contains the Validate class for input validation based on specified rules.

# Note
This is a basic example for educational purposes. In a real-world application, you would need to implement additional security measures and error handling.
